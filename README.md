In this tutorial we use the Python Data Analysis Library **``pandas``** to  show how easy it is to read, clean, analyse, and visualize data. I will use observational data in CSV format to highlight the main features of ``pandas`` and ``matplotlib``.

*Intended audience:* Researchers and students interest in data analysis and cleaning. Some basic understanding of the Python programming language is necessary to follow the presentation.

*Pre-talk preparation:* Install a Python distribution (python 2.7) with ``Pandas``, ``IPython Notebook`` and ``matplotlib`` , e.g. the anaconda distribution: <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>.
